# the Impact of Income Inquality - The class project of MGT 4250 Fall 2023 at Elon University



## Project Questions
- Q1: What are the key drivers for income inequality?
- Q2: How does race affect the median income of everyday people?
- Q3: What is the impact of Gender and Education on income levels? 

## Why we Picked These Questions
- Income Inequality has a significant societal and economic impact, and it is important that we understand the factors that lead to inequality for greater economic development.
- When comparing median incomes, it is important to factor in race as the data could highlight challenges that certain racial groups go through.

Technological Impact:
- Bar chart illustrating the distribution of income across different industries.
- X-axis: Industries, Y-axis: Hourly Earnings.
- Highlight industries with a significant technological impact. 
- This data explains how the industry you work in affects income levels, and how gender also has a serious input.
- By visualizing income distribution across industries, you can identify sectors where technological advancements may be contributing to income disparities. We can see which industries are most frequent in which locations, and see how this can impact income inequality.
